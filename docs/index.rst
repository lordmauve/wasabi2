    :alt: Welcome to Wasabi2d

Wasabi2d is a game engine for Python, making it easy to use fast, modern
graphical effects without low-level OpenGL programming.

Wasabi2d is

* Pretty, thanks to the selection of fast effects such as particles and blurs
* Written in pure Python
* Fast due to heavy use of numpy, ModernGL and GPU acceleration
* Cross platform thanks to Pygame for window creation, input handling and sound
* Easy to use: many of the APIs should be familiar to users of Pygame Zero, the
  zero-boilerplate game framework for beginners.
