Post-processing effects
=======================

Wasabi2d provides a small number of pre-defined full-screen post processing
effects. These are defined at the layer level, and affect items in that layer
only.

.. method:: Layer.set_effect(name, **kwargs)

    Set the effect for the layer to the given name. Return an object that
    can be used to set the parameters of the effect.


Available effects
-----------------

The effects are described here as separate calls:


.. method:: Layer.set_effect('bloom', radius: float=10)

    Create a light bloom effect, where very bright pixels glow, making them
    look exceptionally bright. The radius controls how far the effect reaches.

        :alt: Example of the light bloom effect


.. method:: Layer.set_effect('trails', fade: float=0.1)

    Apply a "motion blur" effect. Fade is the fraction of the full brightness
    that is visible after 1 second.

.. method:: Layer.set_effect('punch', factor: float=1.0)

    Apply a pinch/punch effect.

    A factor greater than 1.0 creates a "punch" effect; objects near the center
    of the camera are enlarged and objects at the edge are shrunk.

    A factor less than 1.0 creates a "pinch" effect; objects near the center of
    the camera are shrunk and objects at the edge are enlarged.

.. method:: Layer.set_effect('blur', radius: float=10.0)

    Apply a full screen gaussian blur.

    ``radius`` is the maximum radius of the blur.

    The effect runs on the GPU but larger radiuses are more costly to compute.
    The cost of the effect is *O(radius)*.

.. method:: Layer.set_effect('dropshadow', radius: float=10.0, opacity: float=1.0, offset: Tuple[float, float]=(1.0, 1.0))

    Apply a drop-shadow effect: draw an offset, blurred copy layer underneath
    the normal layer contents.

    :param radius: The maximum radius of the blur.
    :param opacity: The opacity of the shadow; 1.0 is black, lower values make
                    the shadow partially transparent.
    :param offset: The offset of the shadow in screen pixels. ``(1, 1)``
                   offsets the shadow downwards and to the right. Note that
                   this is a screen-space effect and these coordinates are
                   always in screen space.

.. method:: Layer.clear_effect()

    Remove the active effect.
